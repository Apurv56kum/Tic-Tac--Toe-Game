# overview
Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where each player takes turns marking a square on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line with your own symbol. This repository provides a console-based implementation of the game, allowing you to play against a friend.

## Features
- Two players can play the game.
- Players take turns to place their mark (either "X" or "O") on the game board.
- The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If no player gets three marks in a row and the game board is full, the game ends in a tie.
